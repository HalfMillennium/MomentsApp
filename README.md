# Moments

The complete vision of "Moments" is still not fully defined, but it will be an angular application.

Users will be able to create accounts, and select preferences (e.g. hobbies, interests, etc.).

This data will be used to filter Google Trends data and present users with **spaces** corresponding to stories that would likely interest them.

When a user enters this space, they will be guided through the different aspects of the event/phenomenon in a series of chunks, with the content curated by ChatGPT. In this way, ChatGPT will act as a *reporter* that will digest several articles on a particular topic and not only present users with adequate summaries, but also highlight and explain potential plans of action, or further related reading.

TECH STACK:
NodeJS-based Angular, with GraphQL to be used for user and trend data queries.
